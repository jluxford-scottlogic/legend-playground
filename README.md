### Legend

This is a set of introductory files and exercises to help people learn [legend](https://legend.finos.org/), it is probably worthwhile also looking through the official docs and Github as another good place to start.

This will have a basic format that will not assume any previous legend knowledge and will slowly work through some of the basic concepts from Classes through to Mappings. Currently this help does not cover deployments of services or connecting with databases. A lot of the design is using pre-built tests in mappings and so the main place to practise writing mapping tests will be in the more free form exercises.

Currently this set is still somewhat a work in progress so any updates or feedback is much appreciated.
